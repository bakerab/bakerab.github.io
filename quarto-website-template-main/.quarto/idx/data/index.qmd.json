Although the differences are minor, you should replace the old version with this 2.0 version if you downloaded it prior to July 2016. Because of the proliferation of many new parties for which we do not yet have expert-generated ideological scores, we are not sure when we will update the legislative elections data.**</p>\n\nUsed in:\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0;\">\n<li> Andy Baker and Kenneth F.
